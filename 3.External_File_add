// JavaScript Render Blocking
Anytime a browser encounters a JavaScript file reference, 
it stops the rendering of the page until the script file is downloaded and executed.
If the Script calls for a code that cannot be parsed at that time, the rendering stops.

JavaScript loading methods:
1 Load right away
  HTML will parse
2 Load asynchronously
3 Deferred loading until everything else has loaded
